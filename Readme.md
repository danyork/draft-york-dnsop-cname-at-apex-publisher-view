This IETF Internet Draft is created using the kramdown-rfc tool found at:

https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629

Once you have installed the tools, you should just be able to type `kdrfc` to generate the 
appropriate `.txt` and `.xml` files.

More info about using Markdown to create Internet Drafts [can be found in a presentation I 
gave to the IETF Boston community group](https://github.com/danyork/writing-internet-drafts-in-markdown/) in June 2018.
